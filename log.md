# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 17 December 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Literally just added some html for radio buttons

**Thoughts:** Pathetic start. It was my birthday so went out to the Burmese temple and had a nice meal. Bought a bunch of stuff for the house and then was exhausted when I got back home.

### Day 1: 18 December 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Forked this [100 Days of Code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and edited the readme and updated logs

**Thoughts:** Another really bad effort. I don't think editing markdown files even counts.
