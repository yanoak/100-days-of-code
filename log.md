# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 17 December 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Literally just added some html for radio buttons

**Thoughts:** Pathetic start. It was my birthday so went out to the Burmese temple and had a nice meal. Bought a bunch of stuff for the house and then was exhausted when I got back home.
